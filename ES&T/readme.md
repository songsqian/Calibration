This folder includes the manuscript submitted to ES&T.  The submitted manuscript (in LaTeX) is in the folder `MS`.  Data and R code are in the folder `R`. The raw data used in this manuscript are internal lab documents, not publicly available. We uploaded (to the folder `R`) our Rmarkdown file (`Reading_Data_Sheets.Rmd`) used for reading and processing these raw data files and the resulting processed R data. To replicate the results, one should run the other three R markdown files in the order of (1) `ELISA_BHM_Prior.Rmd`, (2) `ELISA_models_manuscript.Rmd`, and (3) `ELISA_manuscript_plots.Rmd`.
