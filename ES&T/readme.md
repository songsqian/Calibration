This folder includes the manuscript submitted to ES&T.  The submitted manuscript (in LaTeX) is in the folder `MS`.  Data and R code are in the folder `R`. The raw data used in this manuscript are internal lab documents, not publicly available. We uploaded (to the folder `R`) our Rmarkdown file (`Reading_Data_Sheets.Rmd`) used for reading and processing these raw data files and the resulting processed R data. The entire work can be reproduced by the other three R markdown files.
